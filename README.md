# Machine Learning Exercise/Lab Repository of ML course @POLIMI
Welcome to my Machine Learning Exercise/Lab repository! This repository contains my collection of exercises and labs focused on various machine learning topics, implemented using Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and more. Additionally, it covers statistical concepts, generalized linear regression, logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, support vector machines (SVM), decision trees, random forests, K-means clustering, DBSCAN, principal component analysis (PCA), and data visualization techniques using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Tableau.
